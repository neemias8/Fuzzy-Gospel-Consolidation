# Evaluation Methods Status

## ⚠️ Important Notice About Evaluation Results

This document clarifies the current implementation status of evaluation methods in the Fuzzy Gospel Consolidation system.

## Current Status

### ✅ **Implemented and Working**
- **Automatic Metrics**: ROUGE, BERTScore, METEOR, BLEU (using Golden Sample reference)
- **Temporal Coherence**: Kendall's Tau, temporal accuracy, chronological violations
- **Fuzzy Relations**: Same event detection, conflict calculation, temporal ordering

### ⚠️ **Partially Implemented (Uses PLACEHOLDER values)**
- **Conflict Handling Evaluation**
- **Content Coverage Analysis**

## Placeholder Values Explained

### Conflict Handling
The current evaluation reports:
- **8 conflicts mentioned** (PLACEHOLDER)
- **6 conflicts resolved** (PLACEHOLDER) 
- **75% handling rate** (PLACEHOLDER)

**Reality**: The fuzzy relation calculator found:
- Maximum conflict score: 0.2027 (below threshold of 0.6)
- **0 actual conflicts detected** above threshold
- No real conflict resolution occurred

### Content Coverage  
The current evaluation reports:
- **82% event coverage** (PLACEHOLDER)
- **88% gospel representation** (PLACEHOLDER)
- **91% key participants mentioned** (PLACEHOLDER)

**Reality**: These values are hardcoded and not calculated from actual data analysis.

## What Needs To Be Implemented

### For Conflict Handling
1. **Real Conflict Detection**:
   - Implement detection based on known Gospel discrepancies
   - Use test cases from config.yaml (Peter's denial, Temple cleansing, Triumphal Entry)
   - Lower conflict threshold or improve detection algorithm

2. **Conflict Resolution Analysis**:
   - Analyze summary text for conflict resolution strategies
   - Detect when alternative accounts are presented
   - Measure effectiveness of merging strategies

### For Content Coverage
1. **Event Coverage Analysis**:
   - Count events actually mentioned in summary vs. total events
   - Implement keyword/semantic matching for event identification
   
2. **Gospel Representation**:
   - Analyze balance of content from each Gospel (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John)
   - Ensure proportional representation
   
3. **Key Participants**:
   - Identify and count mentions of key figures (Jesus, disciples, religious leaders)
   - Verify important locations and concepts are covered

## How to Identify Placeholder Results

When running the system, look for:
- Log warnings: "Using PLACEHOLDER values for [metric] - not based on real data"
- In evaluation reports: Sections marked "(PLACEHOLDER VALUES)"
- In results files: Metrics that remain constant across runs

## Next Steps

1. **Implement real conflict detection** using fuzzy relations data
2. **Add content analysis** based on actual summary content
3. **Remove placeholder warnings** once real implementations are in place
4. **Update test cases** to match the actual Gospel data structure

## Current Recommendation

**Do not use the Conflict Handling and Content Coverage metrics for research purposes** until the placeholder implementations are replaced with real data analysis.

The temporal coherence and automatic metrics provide reliable evaluation results and can be trusted for research applications.
